Tired of the abundance of phone cleaners on the Play Store? Tired of
them being extremely shady? Tired of them doing nothing? Tired of ads?
Tired of having to pay? Me too.

There are simply way too many apps out there that claim to "speed up your device". In reality, they don't do anything.
LTE Cleaner only aims to clean your phone by removing safe to delete files, which not only frees up a lot of space, but also improve your privacy. Since LTE Cleaner removes .log files, which well, log what you do.

__LTE Cleaner is 100% free, open source, no ads, and deletes everything it claims to.__

### Install

[Original source code (outdated)](https://github.com/theredspy15/LTECleanerFOSS)
[Original GitHub release (outdated)](https://github.com/theredspy15/LTECleanerFOSS)

### Features
- Clipboard clearing
- Whitelist & Blacklist customization with comprehensive defaults
- Daily scheduled cleanup with background work manager
- **Elevated Access via Shizuku & ADB**:
  - Clean internal app caches (`/data/data/*/cache`, `/data/user/0/*/cache`, `code_cache`)
  - Clean system temp directories (`/data/local/tmp`)
  - Elevated deletion fallback for stubborn or restricted directories
  - Built-in ADB setup script generator with one-tap copy
- **Parallel Multi-Threaded Processing**:
  - High-performance concurrent directory scanning and deletion
  - Configurable parallel worker slider in Settings (1 to 10 threads)
- **Accurate Space Calculation**:
  - Floating-point precision byte calculations across B, KB, MB, and GB
  - Recursive directory sizing before removal
- **Secondary Storage Support**:
  - MicroSD card and external removable drive scanning & cleaning

### Cleans:
- Empty folders
- Logs
- Temporary files
- Internal and external app caches
- Advertisement folders
- Corpses (leftovers from uninstalled apps)
- Android APK leftovers and installer caches

### Unit Testing & Quality
Local JVM unit test suite powered by JUnit 4 (`gradle :app:testDebugUnitTest`) validating:
- Size formatters and byte converters across all size thresholds
- Default blacklist regex rules against common junk patterns (`LOST.DIR`, `.tmp`, `.crdownload`, `logs`)
- Filter and whitelist integrity

To do list (not guaranteed because i'm busy irl):
- Black background on dark theme?
- (proper) Fragments?
- Predictive back gestures?
- Extra optimizations?
- Code cleanups
- Compose? (really low priority, because this will literally take decades to implement, lots of code changes, and importantly will took longer to compile and requires more resource and increases APK size to 50MB!! (see Open Video Editor project, before and after the Compose update))
- baseline profile (not ready yet...)
- Clean SD card (has to support minimal Android 10+, hopefully we can use StorageAccessFramework to make this work, but it might be a huge work that can take days, not possible with my spare time)
- Regex whilelist
- About screen (designing the UI would be really painful, and using external dependency will also significantly enlarge file size)
<!-- Scan then clean, instead of doing both at the same time (atleast on some devices that i tested on, it lags when there is so many files)-->

### Compiling the app
First, export some variables (for Linux users. Windows user might want to adjust this a bit):
```bash
export JAVA_HOME="${JAVA_HOME:-/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-amd64}"
export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT="${ANDROID_SDK_ROOT:-~/.android/SDK}"```

Then go to the project root directory, and run this command:
```bash
./gradlew :app:assembleRelease```

if you're using Windows, change `./gradlew` to `gradlew.bat`
